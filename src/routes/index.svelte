    <h1>Welcome to my personal virtual space!</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Daniel Salvado, I'm an enthusiastic developer who loves
        to work within the JavaScript ecosystem and always strive to improve on
        code and build beautiful apps.
    </p>
    <p>
        In here you will be able to find some of the work that I've done, places
        where I've worked and some articles that I've written.
    </p>
    <p>
        I love to share my know-how and things that I find interesting and
        because of that I do some writing on things that I've tested and in some
        way, helped me on the products that I was building!
    </p>
    <p>
        Feel free to share the articles or even to contact me if you have any
        questions, suggestions or simply say hi!
    </p>
    <Bio />
