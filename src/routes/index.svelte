	<h1>Welcome to my personal virtual space!</h1>
	<p>
		Hi, my name is Daniel Salvado, I'm an enthusiastic developer who loves to work within the
		JavaScript ecosystem and always strive to improve on code and build beautiful apps.
	</p>
	<p>
		In here you will be able to find some of the work that I've done, places where I've worked and
		some articles that I've written.
	</p>
	<p>
		I love to share my know-how and things that I find interesting and because of that I do some
		writing on things that I've tested and in some way, helped me on the products that I was
		building!
	</p>
	<p>
		Feel free to share the articles or even to contact me if you have any questions, suggestions or
		simply say hi!
	</p>
