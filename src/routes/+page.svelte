	<p>
		I am a senior frontend engineer at <a href="https://mindera.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mindera</a> focused on building scalable web
		systems and improving developer experience. I
		work primarily with React and TypeScript, designing architectures that balance performance, maintainability,
		and long-term product evolution.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am currently working on complex frontend platforms where migration strategy, system design, and tooling
		quality matter as much as feature delivery. A big part of my work involves improving build pipelines,
		strengthening type safety, and creating environments where teams can move faster with fewer regressions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alongside engineering, I am completing an MBA, where I focus on strategy, innovation, and operations. My
		research explores the determinants of innovation in technology SMEs, with a particular interest in how
		organisational structure, learning capacity, and digitalisation influence long-term competitiveness.
	</p>
	<p>
		Outside of client work, I build and explore new ideas. I'm interested in how systems thinking applies
		across software, business, and capital allocation.

		Most of my technical work lives on <a

	>GitHub</a>. Outside of work, I spend time with my family, study, and train myself to think better — about
		code, business, and the long game.</p>
